Project 4: Exploring the UK's milk imports and exports

by Gonzalo Gomez Millan based on version of Tony Hirst and Michel Wermelinger, 19 November 2015 and 28 March 2016

This is the project notebook for Week 4 of The Open University's Learn to Code for Data Analysis course.

A country's economy depends, sometimes heavily, on its exports and imports. The United Nations Comtrade database provides data on global trade. It will be used to analyse the UK's imports and exports of milk and cream in 2015:

- How much does the UK export and import and is the balance positive (more exports than imports)?
- Which are the main trading partners, i.e. from/to which countries does the UK import/export the most?
- Which are the regular customers, i.e. which countries buy milk from the UK every month?
- Which countries does the UK both import from and export to?

**Remember If you want to execute the project, you should have installed the Anaconda package 3 with IPython Notebook. http://http://www.open.edu/openlearn/learn-to-code-installation
